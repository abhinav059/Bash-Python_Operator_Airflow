# Apache Airflow: BashOperator and PythonOperator Examples

This repository contains two simple examples demonstrating how to use **BashOperator** and **PythonOperator** in Apache Airflow. These operators are widely used in Airflow DAGs to define tasks that run either Bash commands or Python functions, making them essential for building versatile data pipelines.

## About Apache Airflow

**Apache Airflow** is an open-source platform used to author, schedule, and monitor workflows programmatically. Airflow allows users to define workflows as DAGs (Directed Acyclic Graphs), which consist of tasks that are executed in a defined order.

With Airflow, you can:

- Schedule tasks and workflows based on a variety of triggers (time-based, event-based).
- Monitor and troubleshoot tasks using its web-based user interface.
- Execute complex workflows by chaining tasks together.

## Operators in Apache Airflow

Operators are building blocks of an Airflow DAG. Each operator defines a specific action that will be executed. This project focuses on two types of operators:

### BashOperator

The **BashOperator** allows you to execute shell commands or Bash scripts directly from an Airflow DAG. This is useful for running shell commands, invoking shell scripts, or interacting with the underlying operating system.

#### Use Cases:
- Running shell scripts or CLI commands.
- Performing file operations like moving or copying files.
- Simple shell-based automation tasks like system monitoring.

### PythonOperator

The **PythonOperator** enables you to execute a Python function as a task within your DAG. It allows you to write Python logic directly in your DAG and is useful when you need to integrate business logic, process data, or call external APIs within your workflow.

#### Use Cases:
- Executing Python functions for data processing or transformation.
- Invoking Python scripts to interact with databases or web services.
- Performing custom logic that is easily handled in Python.

## About the Code

This repository contains two Apache Airflow DAGs, one showcasing the **BashOperator** and the other demonstrating the **PythonOperator**.

- **BashOperator Example**: The DAG uses BashOperator to print "Hello, World!" to the Airflow logs by executing a Bash command.
- **PythonOperator Example**: This DAG uses PythonOperator to print "Hello, World!" by executing a simple Python function.

Both examples show how to define basic tasks in Airflow using different operators.

## How to Use the DAGs

1. **Prerequisites**: Ensure you have Apache Airflow installed and properly configured. The repository assumes Airflow is set up with the correct paths to your DAGs folder.

2. **Steps**:
   - Clone the repository and place the DAG files into your Airflow DAGs directory.
   - Start the Airflow web server and scheduler:
     ```bash
     airflow webserver --port 8080
     airflow scheduler
     ```
   - Open the Airflow UI in your browser (usually at `http://localhost:8080`) and you should see the DAGs listed.
   - Trigger the DAGs manually to see the output of each operator.
